## Submitted Proposal

Title: Running a Kaggle Competition Team: BirdCLEF with Data Science @ Georgia Tech

Modality: Traditional Talk

Abstract:

I will present my experience running a Kaggle competition team with people from DS@GT and the OMSCS program.
I will cover how I got started with Kaggle, and why I decided to build a team with people from Georgia Tech.
I will provide context on the BirdCLEF, an information retrieval challenge to aid in bird conservation.
I will discuss the recruitment process (be proactive, reach out to existing communities, build an assessment and interview appropriately).
I will talk about three iterations of teams that I have formed (2022 competition team, fall 2022 eda group, 2023 competition team).
I will discuss the techniques and models used in the projects.
I will also provide commentary on how OMSCS students can engage with the student body on focused technical projects, and some advice that I would give myself a year and a half ago.
Attendees will learn about resources available to them (EdStem, DS@GT, Kaggle).
They may be encouraged to seek non-traditional paths to further foster their growth during their time in OMSCS.
