## Abstract (250 words or less)

Are you interested in leveraging your computer and data science skills to tackle real-world problems?
Then, join me for a traditional talk on my experience leading a successful Kaggle competition team with people from DS@GT and the OMSCS program.

Our team took on the BirdCLEF challenge, an information retrieval competition focused on bird conservation.
I'll share how I got started with Kaggle and why I decided to build a team with people from Georgia Tech.
But this presentation is more than just a recap of our Kaggle journey.
I'll also provide commentary on how OMSCS students can engage with the student body on focused technical projects and offer advice I wish I had received when I started.

Additionally, you'll learn about the available resources, such as EdStem, DS@GT, and Kaggle, and how they can help you explore non-traditional paths to further foster your growth during your time in OMSCS.
By attending this presentation, you'll gain knowledge of the recruitment process, techniques, and models used in the project and how you can take on a real-world challenge and lead a successful Kaggle competition team.
